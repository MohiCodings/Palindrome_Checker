Palindrome Checker
-A palindrome is a word, number, phrase, or other sequence of characters which reads the same backward as forward ignoring punctuation, case, and spacing.
-A palindrome is a word or sentence that's spelled the same way both forward and backward, ignoring punctuation, case, and spacing (e.g. mom, dad, racecar, madam). A palindrome checker checks if a string is a palindrome or not.

This application asks a user for a phrase or a word. It checks the user input, runs palindrome check on it, and tells user whether the entered string is a palindrome or not.

FreeCodeCamp Palindrome Checker - JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures Projects (https://learn.freecodecamp.org/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures-projects/palindrome-checker)

-Return true if the given string is a palindrome. Otherwise, return false. A palindrome is a word or sentence that's spelled the same way both forward and backward, ignoring punctuation, case, and spacing.

-Note You'll need to remove all non-alphanumeric characters (punctuation, spaces and symbols) and turn everything into the same case (lower or upper case) in order to check for palindromes.

-We'll pass strings with varying formats, such as "racecar", "RaceCar", and "race CAR" among others.

-We'll also pass strings with special symbols, such as "2A33a2", "2A3 3a2", and "2_A33#A2".

##Test cases
palindrome("eye") should return a boolean.
palindrome("eye") should return true.
palindrome("_eye") should return true.
palindrome("race car") should return true.
palindrome("not a palindrome") should return false.
palindrome("A man, a plan, a canal. Panama") should return true.
palindrome("never odd or even") should return true.
palindrome("nope") should return false.
palindrome("almostomla") should return false.
palindrome("My age is 0, 0 si ega ym.") should return true.
palindrome("1 eye for of 1 eye.") should return false.
palindrome("0_0 (: /-\ :) 0-0") should return true.
